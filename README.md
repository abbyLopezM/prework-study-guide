# Prework Study Guide Webpage
 Webpage designed and built to store information learned in the prework readings of the bootcamp. It contains information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
## Description

The motivation for this webpage was to create a place for bootcamp students to keep their note organized. This project was built to serve as a learning activity for bootcamp students to be able to get an introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It meant to help students have more organized note taking and more interactive note taking. I personally learned a lot from the language needed to use to built a site to how to save and upload all our progress.
